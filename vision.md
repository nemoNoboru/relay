# Vision & Architecture

## Executive Summary

A new web platform designed to democratize software development and hosting, moving away from centralized cloud oligarchies (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) toward community-owned infrastructure. The platform combines the simplicity of the original LAMP stack with modern federation capabilities, allowing small communities to host their own web applications while seamlessly connecting to a larger federated network.

## Vision Statement

**Goal**: Create an alternative way of building and deploying software where applications are built by small teams, hosted by communities, and administered by their hosts - completely independent of Silicon Valley cloud platforms.

**Core Principles**:

- **Community-first**: Software owned and operated by its users
- **Federation-native**: Seamless collaboration across independent nodes
- **Developer-friendly**: As easy to learn as BASIC was in the 1980s
- **Deployment-simple**: Single binary distribution, no complex configuration
- **Escape-hatch ready**: Can drop down to lower-level code when needed

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Web Development Issues

- **Platform dependency**: Everything runs on AWS/Azure/Google Cloud
- **Oligarchy control**: A few companies control the entire internet infrastructure
- **Complexity barrier**: Modern web development requires dozens of tools and services
- **Centralization**: Users have no control over their data or the platforms they use
- **High costs**: Cloud hosting pricing excludes small communities and hobbyists

### What We Miss from the LAMP Era

- **Ubiquitous knowledge**: Every web developer knew PHP
- **Instant deployment**: Upload a file, see results immediately
- **Cheap hosting**: $5/month shared hosting was sufficient
- **Simple mental model**: Apache + MySQL + PHP just worked
- **Community ownership**: People could run their own servers
