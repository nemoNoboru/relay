  - Basic component rendering with Tailwind styling
  - Environment updates flowing to preview

#### Milestone: Hello World Demo
- Complete hello world project template demonstrating:
  - Data display with cards/lists
  - Basic form handling
  - Multiple pages working together
  - Function composition between `.rld` and `.rl` files
  - All built-in components in action

---

### Phase 2: Component System (Months 4-5)
**Goal: Rich component library and extensibility**

#### Built-in Component Library
- **Data Display**: `card`, `list-item`, `table-row`, `heading`, `paragraph`
- **Forms**: `input-text`, `button`, `select`, `checkbox`
- **Layout**: `container`, `grid`, `column`
- **Content**: `image`, media components

#### Plugin Architecture
- **Component Composition System**
  - `def-component` syntax for composing base components
  - Props passing and children handling
  - Component registry and discovery

- **JavaScript Escape Hatch**
  - `def-js` integration for custom React components
  - Seamless interop between Relay and JavaScript components
  - Type safety and prop validation

#### Enhanced Desktop Experience
- **Component Browser**
  - Visual component gallery within desktop app
  - Live component testing and preview
  - Documentation and examples for each component

- **Project Templates**
  - Multiple starter templates (blog, todo app, portfolio, business site)
  - Template customization and user-created templates

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 6-8)
**Goal: Production-ready development environment**

#### Extended Relay Language
- **Control Flow**: `for`, `if`, `filter` operations
- **Math Operations**: `add`, `minus`, `less`, `equal`, comparison functions
- **File Operations**: Robust `load` system with dependency management
- **Form Handling**: Complete form processing with validation

#### Development Tools
- **Debugging System**
  - Variable inspection and environment viewing
  - Step-through debugging for Relay code
  - Performance profiling for complex applications

- **Testing Framework**
  - Docstring-based testing (inspired by Elixir)
  - Automatic mocking for database and external services
  - Test runner integrated into desktop app

- **Project Management**
  - Multi-file search and replace
  - Refactoring tools (rename variables, extract functions)
  - Dependency tracking between `.rld` and `.rl` files

#### Quality Assurance
- **Error Handling**
  - Comprehensive error messages with suggestions
  - Runtime error recovery
  - Graceful degradation for partial failures

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Lazy loading for large projects
  - Incremental parsing and rendering
  - Memory management for long-running sessions

---

### Phase 4: Server Integration (Months 9-12)
**Goal: Full-stack development with server deployment**

#### Server-Side Execution
- **`when` Directive Implementation**
  - Page load, form submit, and custom event handling
  - Server-side rendering with SEO optimization
  - Session and state management

- **Database Integration**
  - Production database backends (PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - Migration system for schema changes
  - Data modeling and relationships

#### Deployment System
- **Local to Cloud Publishing**
  - One-click deployment to Relay cloud
  - Environment management (dev/staging/production)
  - Custom domain support

- **Relay Cloud Infrastructure**
  - Federated hosting architecture
  - Community-owned instances
  - Load balancing and scaling

#### Advanced Web Features
- **Real-time Capabilities**
  - WebSocket integration
  - Live updates and collaborative features
  - Push notifications

- **API Integration**
  - External service connectors
  - OAuth and authentication systems
  - Payment processing integration

---

### Phase 5: Ecosystem & Community (Months 12+)
**Goal: Thriving community and component ecosystem**

#### GitHub Gist Integration
- **`load` Directive for Remote Components**
  - Direct GitHub gist loading
  - Version pinning and dependency management
  - Component discovery and search

- **Community Features**
  - Component sharing and rating system
  - Best practices documentation
  - Community challenges and showcases

#### Platform Maturity
- **Educational Resources**
  - Interactive tutorials within desktop app

- **Component Complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication gradually
- **Desktop App Stability**: Comprehensive testing, graceful error handling

**Adoption Risks:**
- **Learning Curve**: Invest heavily in documentation and tutorials
- **Ecosystem Development**: Seed initial components, incentivize contributions
- **Platform Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition (simplicity + power)

**Sustainability Risks:**
- **Development Resources**: Build community early, establish governance
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring, maintain code quality
- **Community Fragmentation**: Clear standards, effective communication
